	      2. What about code that is analogous to that in Question 1, but that uses ArrayList? For example:
          ArrayList<Point> a = new ArrayList<Point>();
          ArrayList<Object> b;
          b = a;
          b.add(new Point(10,20));
          
          **************ANSWER***************
       
            The code doesn't compile, it has an error at the assignment b=a (ArrayList<Point> cannot be 
          converted into ArrayList<Object>.
