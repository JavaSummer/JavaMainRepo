     3. Sketch the class definition and method signatures for a Stack class, parameterized by the type of element on the
    stack. Give the method signatures for push, pop, and isEmpty.
 
 ****************ANSWER***************
  class Stack(){
      //Class short definition: The Stack class represents a last in first out stack of objects. 
     **It extends the Vector class with 5 operations that allow
       a vector to be treated as Stack.
      
     //PUSH METHOD:
       T push(T element){
       // pushes an element onto the top of the stack and returns the element argument.
      } 
      
     //POP METHOD:
      T pop(){
        // it removes the object at the top of the stack and returns that object.
        * If the stack happens to be empty,the method will throw the EmptyStackException.
      }
      
     //ISEMPTY METHOD:
      boolean isEmpty(){
      // This method returns true if the stack has no elements in it, or false if it has at least one element.
      }
      
      }
