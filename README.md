# Java Summer course(ish)

##


### What to expect
- A good progression scheme through the basic concepts of OOP (in Java)
- A good chunk of exercises and assignments which should offer (if properly done) good insight on new OOP concepts and Java's specific innards.
- After completing this course, you should be able to *think* in the (for some) new OOP paradigm with ease and you will be able to model a problem according to these knew principles and concepts


### What not to expect
- A *hold my hand while I learn Java* type of interaction. The purpose is not to reproduce an elementary-school type class but rather point the student into a direction and guide him/her on a path.
- A mastery of OOP and Java. Maybe in 5-10 years.
